This Project revolves around creating various scenarios using multiple datasets for Naive Bayes, Apriori and Decision Tree. I have installed Knime, A platform which provides a work board space where you can use various nodes for your suitable requirements. Using the nodes present in knime, I have created various work environments for respective algorithms along with the code.
