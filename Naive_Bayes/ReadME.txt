This project is about using a naive Bayes classifier to predict the class of weather conditions for playing golf. A naive Bayes classifier is a data minning algorithm that calculates the probability of a class given some features, based on Bayes' theorem. It assumes that the features are independent of each other, which simplifies the computation. The project involves loading a CSV file with weather data, splitting it into train and test sets, creating and fitting a Gaussian naive Bayes model, making predictions on the test set, and evaluating the model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. The project is implemented in Python using pandas, sklearn, and other libraries.
